## [Uncomplicated][permalink]

Early this morning, unable to sleep, I finished reading [_Raspberry Pi Networking Cookbook_][cookbook]. Late last week, I installed [the Uncomplicated Firewall][ufw-wikipedia] via the command line, doubly making sure that SSH was enabled. Otherwise making I wouldn't be able to access it through the network and would have to set up the thing again. I also installed <code>whois</code> to do quick checks if a domains is available from my phone if need be without having to resort to SSHing into my California-based VPS. The final recipe of the book has us making the Raspberry Pi a wireless access point, and lacking the hardware necessary, I'm putting that one off. [The list of software installed][software] is up to date, and I plan on adding a page listing the hardware connected to my unit.
