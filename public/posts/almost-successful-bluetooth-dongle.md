This came in for me last week, so I hope to be able to use create a Node.js-based iBeacon in my house using [Bleacon](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/node-bleacon) and [some instructions](https://github.com/mschmulen/tracking-bluetooth-ibeacons-with-node) using [Estimote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/estimote-virtual-beacon/id686915066). So far I'm unable to install Bleacon because, I believe, I insist on using the latest available binary for Node.js for Raspberry Pi.

At least the hardware works. It's just the Node module failing to install. Getting software to work has always been easier than getting hardware to work, so I will persist.
