## [Successful Wi-Fi Dongle Connection](/posts/successful-wi-fi-dongle-connection)

After a few days rest and looking again at the open tab on my iPad, I decided to give the WiFi dongle another go. A more sober reading of [Nathan Wittstock's instructions on getting WiFi on a headless Raspberry Pi](http://milkandtang.com/blog/2013/08/27/getting-wifi-on-a-headless-raspberry-pi/) led to moving some lines in <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> around and commenting out some lines in <code>/etc/wpa\_supplicant/wpa\_supplicant.conf</code>. After a reboot, I connected to the internal IP address I associated with the WiFi dongle and voila! I'm connected. Taking out the Ethernet cable confirms it. That means being able to take the Raspberry Pi unit away from the bedroom (where the router lives) and into the office to hack away more efficiently on getting the Bluetooth dongle working.
