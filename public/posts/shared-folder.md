Reading the chapter on sharing folders from other computers from [_Raspberry Pi Networking Cookbook_][cookbook] this morning, I decided to do the opposite: share my Raspberry Pi over my local network with my Mac. [Henrik Jachobsen has some easy-to-follow instructions][instructions], and there it is, my Raspberry Pi! (I named it [Ix as an homage to Ford Prefect of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy][ix].) I followed the instructions exactly, except that I used Emacs, of course, and added Samba to the list of software I've installed on my Raspberry Pi. Did I mention that I have [a list of software I've installed on my Raspberry Pi][software]?
